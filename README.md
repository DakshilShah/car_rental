--General Information / Assumptions--
1) sample1.json file contains the json data which was provided in the pdf.
2) sample.json is the file which is created using script.py which contains the script to create data for the project. You can change the number at line 7 (enter the number of data you want to create as dummy data).
3) script.py file is written in such a way that not all entries will have end_time.

--Running the project--
1) Inorder to have a very large input files you can run script.py using the command python script.py in your terminal.
2) If not, just change line 5 in "main.py" file to "sample1.json" instead of "sample.json"
3) Finally run main.py file which will generate summary(output.json) file. Inorder to do so, run python main.py command in your terminal.
